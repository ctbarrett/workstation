# workstation cookbook

## Description

<!-- TODO: Insert links to jtimberman workstation cookbook and blog posts -->
This is my take on a workstation configuration cookbook, similar to [this cookbook](link) and [related](link)
[blog](link) [posts](link) by Josh Timberman, among others.

This cookbook will configure various settings, and install preferred applications. Given the highly
personal nature of a workstation configuration, these settings are things that suit me and my personal work style. YMMV
disclaimers naturally apply.
